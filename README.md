# Machine Learning
My personal machine learning portfolio

This repository is my personal portfolio about basic concepts of machine learning. I put here a lot of things that i've studied on articles and courses about ML. Little by little, i will updating this repo with data cleaning, supervised and unsupervised learning algoritms, dimensionality reduction and reinforcement learning as well. I will create an advanced section with little applications and projects with some frameworks like tensorflow and pytorch.

Enjoy and feel free to contact me with any doubts!
