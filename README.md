# Machine Learning
My personal machine learning portfolio

This repository is my personal portfolio about machine learning. I put here a lot of things that i've studied on articles and courses about ML. Little by little, i will updating this repo with supervised and unsupervised learning algoritms, dimensionality reduction and reinforcement learning as well. 

Enjoy and feel free to contact me with any doubts!
